Our esteemed IEEE student branch was established in 2008 and has been flourishing ever since.<br><br>
            IEEE GTBIT SB has been enhancing the technical skills of the student members, helping them on the way with a very holistic growth plan. We have 3 chapters functioning in our college, namely the main IEEE student branch, IEEE WIE, and IEEE CS, all of which are closely-knit and make our society form a strong peer-network bond, this has greatly helped us in improving the communication skills of our students.
            In addition, we are the sole professional society in the college which makes joining IEEE an experience of its own. Conducting various conferences, events, workshops, making event reports, creating IEEE research papers, SIGs for different fields, International competitions, and many more activities have enabled us to produce capable and successful students since our inception, thus making us good at what we do.</p>

            into better working professionals that are industry-tailored. Expanding the knowledge pool of students and giving
            them practical exposure is one of our top priorities also many others like group discussion and communication skills.
            Our mentors connect with various other colleges under the IEEE banner that helps give students more exposure and talk
            to real-life industry experts. Our branch helps each member improve their weak spots through workshops organized for
            technical skills, social skills, and more. WIE chapter has been an integral part of our society. Hence we are also committed
            to empowering women in engineering and expanding the list of female engineers.
